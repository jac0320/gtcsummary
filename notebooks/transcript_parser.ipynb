      "told that Blackwell's Ambitions were beyond  the limits of physics uh the engineer said\n",

      "billion the second one's\n",
      "five it gets cheaper after that so  any customers in the audience it's\n",
      "okay all right but this is this one's quite  expensive this is to bring up board and um\n",
      "and the the way it's going to go to production  is like this one here okay and so you're going   to take take this it has two blackw Dy two two  blackw chips and four Blackwell dies connected\n",

      "uh MV link on top PCI Express on the bottom on  on uh your which one is mine and your left one\n",
      "of them it doesn't matter uh one of them one  of them is a CPU chipto chip link is my left\n",
      "or your depending on which side I was just I was  trying to sort that out and I just kind of doesn't\n",
      "matter hopefully it comes plugged in\n",
      "so okay so this is the grace Blackwell\n",
      "system\n",
      "but there's more so it turns out it turns out all of the  specs is fantastic but we need a whole lot of\n",
      "new features uh in order to push the limits  Beyond if you will the limits of physics we\n",
      "would like to always get a lot more X factors and  so one of the things that we did was We Invented\n",
      "another Transformer engine another Transformer  engine the second generation it has the ability\n",

      "whenever it can remember artificial intelligence  is about probability and so you kind of have you\n",
      "know 1.7 approximately 1.7 time approximately  1.4 to be approximately something else does\n",
      "that make sense and so so the the ability for  the mathematics to retain the Precision and the\n",
      "range necessary in that particular stage of the  pipeline super important and so this is it's not\n",
      "just about the fact that we designed a smaller ALU  it's not quite the world's not quite that simple\n",
      "you've got to figure out when you can use that  across a computation that is thousands of gpus\n",
      "it's running for weeks and weeks on weeks and you  want to make sure that the the uh uh the training\n",
      "job is going going to converge and so this new  Transformer engine we have a fifth generation MV\n",
      "link it's now twice as fast as Hopper but very  importantly it has computation in the network\n",
      "and the reason for that is because when you  have so many different gpus working together   we have to share our information with each other  we have to synchronize and update each other and\n",
      "every so often we have to reduce the partial  products and then rebroadcast out the partial\n",
      "products the sum of the partial products back to  everybody else and so there's a lot of what is   called all reduce and all to all and all gather  it's all part of this area of synchronization\n",

      "and being able to do mathematics right in the  network allows us to essentially amplify even\n",
      "further so even though it's 1.8 terabytes per  second it's effectively higher than that and\n",
      "so it's many times that of Hopper the likel  Ood of a supercomputer running for weeks on\n",
      "in is approximately zero and the reason for that  is because there's so many components working at\n",
      "the same time the statistic the probability of  them working continuously is very low and so\n",
      "we need to make sure that whenever there is a  well we checkpoint and restart as often as we\n",

      "of that AI is encoded in the parameters you  want to make sure that on the one hand you   don't lose it on the other hand it doesn't get  contaminated and so we now have the ability to\n",

      "you know the stuff that that is proprietary to  you critical to your company you can encode it\n",

      "you know how many bugs was there last night um  are we making any progress and then after you're\n",
      "done talking to this uh bugs database you need  therapy and so so we have another chatbot for\n",
      "you you can do\n",
      "it okay so we call this Nemo Retriever and the  reason for that is because ultimately it's job\n",
      "is to go retrieve information as quickly as  possible and you just talk to it hey retrieve   me this information it goes if brings it back to  you and do you mean this you go yeah perfect okay\n",
      "and so we call it the Nemo retriever well the  Nemo service helps you create all these things   and we have all all these different Nims we  even have Nims of digital humans I'm Rachel\n",
      "your AI care manager okay so so it's a really  short clip but there were so many videos to\n",
      "show you I guess so many other demos to show  you and so I I had to cut this one short but   this is Diana she is a digital human Nim  and and uh you just talked to her and she's\n",
