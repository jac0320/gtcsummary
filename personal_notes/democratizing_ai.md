# Democratizing AI

Ironically, the first person to mention the term "democratizing AI" was OpenAI's COO Brad Lightcap. He emphasized the importance of enabling a wide range of users to leverage AI technologies for diverse applications. To me, that almost sounds like "We should scoop more users from Google into our closed environment". On the other hand, Mistral, which company open-sources a high-quality smaller talked about how to give AI to users' hands without mentioning "Democratizing AI" once for 45 minutes.

Jokes aside, my takeaways on Democratizing AI is about two things:
1. Enable more people to use and benefit from AI in a non-harms way
2. Don't have AI controlled by a few powerful entities
At least, I am convinced that this will be my mission in helping people build AI products.

Often the time, I ran into such discussion on how can AI solve this question. And I'd always answer, it may not. But, let's think it through. What is the rule of thumb that you may consider AI:
1. **Does your problem have some sort of pattern?** For example, is your task somehow repetitive but not the same every time you do it? Like reply an email, classifying a document, or categorizing a file into the Box folder.
2. **Does your decision require some logic that cannot be explicitly written?** For example, the email you are reading does not always follow the same pattern, but you can tell if it is spam or not. Or, the document you are reading does not always have the same structure, but you can tell if it is a legal document or not.

if you answer yes/maybe to both questions, then you may consider using AI. And if you don't know how to use it, I can help people learn about what AI can do and how to leverage it based on my knowledge and experience. I won't be able to solve all the problems, but I can help you think through the problem and see if you can build an AI solution. Maybe my future wish is to give people the platform to build AI without knowing how to code. But, that is a long way to go. Or is it?
