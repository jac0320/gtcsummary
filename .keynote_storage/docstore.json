how can we start preparing today for what is\nabout to come next well but before I start I  want to show you the soul of Nvidia the soul\nof our company at the intersection of computer  Graphics physics and artificial intelligence\nall intersecting inside a computer in Omniverse  in a virtual world simulation everything we're\ngoing to show you today literally everything  we're going to show you today is a simulation\nnot animation it's only beautiful because it's  physics the world is beautiful it's only amazing\nbecause it's being animated with robotics it's  being animated with artificial intelligence what\nyou're about to see all day it's completely  generated completely simulated and Omniverse\nand all of it what you're about to enjoy is the  world's first concert where everything is homemade\neverything is homemade you're about to watch  some home videos so sit back and enjoy yourself\nGod I love it Nvidia accelerated Computing has reached the  Tipping Point general purpose Computing has\nrun out of steam we need another way of doing  Computing so that we can continue to scale so\nthat we can continue to drive down the cost of  computing so that we can continue to consume\nmore and more Computing while being sustainable  accelerated Computing is a dramatic speed up over\ngeneral purpose Computing and in every single  industry we engage and I'll show you many the\nimpact is dramatic but in no industry is a  more important than our own the industry of\nusing simulation tools to create products in this  industry it is not about driving down the cost of\ncomputing it's about driving up the scale of  computing we would like to be able to sim at\nthe entire product that we do completely  in full Fidelity completely digitally in\nessentially what we call digital twins we would  like to design it build it simulate it operate it\ncompletely digitally in order to do that we need  to accelerate an entire industry and today I would\nlike to announce that we have some Partners who  are joining us in this journey to accelerate their\nentire ecosystem so that we can bring the world  into accelerated Computing but there's a bonus\nwhen you become accelerated your infrastructure  is cou to gpus and when that happens it's exactly\nthe same infrastructure for generative Ai and  so I'm just delighted to announce several very\nimportant Partnerships there are some of the most  important companies in the world and Anis does\nengineering simulation for what the world makes  we're partnering with them to Cuda accelerate the\nAnsys ecosystem to connect Ansys to the Omniverse  digital twin incredible the thing that's really\ngreat is that the install base of media GPU  accelerated systems are all over the world in   every cloud in every system all over Enterprises  and so the app the applications they accelerate\nwill have a giant installed base to go serve end  users will have amazing applications and of course\nsystem makers and csps will have great customer  demand synopsis synopsis is nvidia's literally\nfirst software partner they were there in very  first day of our company synopsis revolutionized\nthe chip industry with high level design we  are going to Cuda accelerate synopsis we're\naccelerating computational lithography one of  the most important applications", "start_char_idx": 3732,

simulation for what the world makes  we're partnering with them to Cuda accelerate the\nAnsys ecosystem to connect Ansys to the Omniverse  digital twin incredible the thing that's really\ngreat is that the install base of media GPU  accelerated systems are all over the world in   every cloud in every system all over Enterprises  and so the app the applications they accelerate\nwill have a giant installed base to go serve end  users will have amazing applications and of course\nsystem makers and csps will have great customer  demand synopsis synopsis is nvidia's literally\nfirst software partner they were there in very  first day of our company synopsis revolutionized\nthe chip industry with high level design we  are going to Cuda accelerate synopsis we're\naccelerating computational lithography one of  the most important applications that nobody's\never known about in order to make chips we have  to push lithography to limit Nvidia has created\na library domain specific library that accelerates  computational lithography incredibly once we can\naccelerate and software Define all of tsmc who  is announcing today that they're going to go into\nproduction with Nvidia kitho once this software  defined and accelerated the next step is to apply\ngenerative AI to the future of semiconductor  manufacturing push in Geometry even further\nCadence builds the world's essential Eda and SDA  tools we also use Cadence between these three\ncompanies ansis synopsis and Cadence we basically  build Nvidia together we are cud accelerating\nCadence they're also building a supercomputer out  of Nvidia gpus so that their customers could do\nfluid Dynamic simulation at a 100 a thousand times  scale basically a wind tunnel in real time Cadence\nMillennium a supercomputer with Nvidia gpus inside  a software company building supercomputers I love\nseeing that building Cadence co-pilots together  imagine a day when Cadence could synopsis ansis\ntool providers would offer you AI co-pilots so  that we have thousands and thousands of co-pilot\nassistants helping us design chips Design Systems  and we're also going to connect Cadence digital\ntwin platform to Omniverse as you could see the  trend here we're accelerating the world's CAE Eda\nand SDA so that we could create our future in  digital Twins and we're going to connect them\nall to Omniverse the fundamental operating  system for future digital twins one of the\nindustries that benefited tremendously from scale  and you know you all know this one very well large\nlanguage model basically after the Transformer  was invented we were able to scale large language\nmodels at incredible rates effectively doubling  every six months now how is it possible that by\ndoubling every six months that we have grown  the industry we have grown the computational\nrequirements so far and the reason for that  is quite simply this if you double the size   of the model you double the size of your brain you  need twice as much information to go fill it and\nso every time you double your parameter count you  also have to appropriately increase your training\ntoken count the combination of those two numbers  becomes the computation scale you have to support\nthe latest the state-of-the-art open AI model is  approximately 1.8 trillion parameters 1.8 trillion\nparameters required several trillion tokens to go  train so so a few trillion parameters on the order\nof a few trillion tokens on the order of when you  multiply the two of them together approximately\n30 40 50 billion quadrillion floating Point  operations per second now we just have to do some\nCo math right now just hang hang with me so you  have 30 billion quadrillion a quadrillion is like\na paa and so if you had a PA flop GPU you would  need 30 billion seconds to go compute to go train\nthat model 30 billion seconds is approximately  1,000 years well 1,000 years it's worth\nit like to do it sooner but it's worth\nit which is usually my answer  when most people tell me hey\nhow long how long's it going to take to  do something 20 years how it it's worth it but can we do it next\nweek and so 1,000 years 1,000 years so what  we need what we need are bigger gpus we need\nmuch much bigger gpus we recognized this early on  and we realized that the answer is to put a whole\nbunch of gpus together and of course innovate  a whole bunch

these giant systems and so  djx1 was our first version but it wasn't the last\nwe built we built supercomputers all the way all  along the way in 2021 we had Seline 4500 gpus or\nso and then in 2023 we built one of the largest AI  supercomputers in the world it's just come online\nEOS and as we're building these things we're  trying to help the world build these things and in\norder to help the

and to balance the workload so  that you can get the most Energy Efficiency the\nbest computation time keep your cost down and so  those those fundamental Innovations is what got us\nhere and here we

these Mo models can be grounded in  physics understands that an arm doesn't go through\na wall and so these models would have common  sense by watching a lot of the world's video\ncombined with a lot

we're going to have ai   working with AI training each other just like  student teacher Debaters all of that is going\nto increase the size of our model it's going  to increase the amount of the

dyes this is the first\ntime two dieses have abutted like this together  in such a way that the two chip the two dieses\nthink it's one chip there's 10 terabytes of  data between it 10 terabytes per second so\nthat these two these two sides of the Blackwell  Chip have no clue which side they're on there's\nno memory locality issues no cach issues it's  just one giant chip and so uh when we were\ntold that Blackwell's Ambitions were beyond  the limits of physics uh the engineer said\nso what and so this is what what happened and  so this is the Blackwell chip and it goes into\ntwo types of systems the first one is form fit  function compatible to Hopper and so you slide\nall Hopper and you push in Blackwell that's the  reason why one of the challenges of ramping is   going to be so efficient there are installations  of Hoppers all over the world and they could be\nthey could be you know the same infrastructure  same design the power the electricity The\nThermals the software identical push it right  back and so this is a hopper version for the\ncurrent hgx configuration and this is what  the other the second Hopper looks like this\nnow this is a prototype board and um Janine  could I just borrow ladies and gentlemen Jan\nPaul and so this this is the this is  a fully functioning board and I just\nbe careful here this right here is I don't know10\nbillion the second one's\nfive it gets cheaper after that so  any customers in the audience it's\nokay all right but this is this one's quite  expensive this is to bring up board and um\nand the the way it's going to go to production  is like this one here okay and so you're going   to take take this it has two blackw Dy two two  blackw chips and four Blackwell dies connected\nto a Grace CPU the grace CPU has a super  fast chipto chip link what's amazing is this\ncomputer is the first of its kind where this much  computation first of all fits into this small of\na place second it's memory coherent they feel  like they're just one big happy family working\non one application together and so everything  is coherent within it um the just the amount\nof you know you saw the numbers there's a lot  of terabytes this and terabytes that's um but\nthis is this is a miracle this is a this let's see  what are some of the things on here uh there's um\nuh MV link on top PCI Express on the bottom on  on uh your which one

Invented\nanother Transformer engine another Transformer  engine the second generation it has the ability\nto dynamically and automatically rescale and  recas numerical formats to a lower Precision\nwhenever it can remember artificial intelligence  is about probability and so you kind of have you\nknow 1.7 approximately 1.7 time approximately  1.4 to be approximately something else does\nthat make sense and so so the the ability for  the mathematics to retain the Precision and the\nrange necessary in that particular stage of the  pipeline super important and so this is it's not\njust about the fact that we designed a smaller ALU  it's not quite the world's not quite that simple\nyou've got to figure out when you can use that  across a computation that is thousands of gpus\nit's running for weeks and weeks on weeks and you  want to make sure that the the uh uh the training\njob is going going to converge and so this new  Transformer engine we have a fifth generation MV\nlink it's now twice as fast as Hopper but very  importantly it has computation in the network\nand the reason for that is because when you  have so many different gpus working together   we have to share our information with each other  we have to synchronize and update each other and\nevery so often we have to reduce the partial  products and then rebroadcast out the partial\nproducts the sum of the partial products back to  everybody else and so there's a lot of what is   called all reduce and all to all and all gather  it's all part of this area of synchronization\nand collectives so that we can have gpus working  with each other having extraordinarily fast links\nand being able to do mathematics right in the  network allows us to essentially amplify even\nfurther so even though it's 1.8 terabytes per  second it's effectively higher than that and\nso it's many times that of Hopper the likel  Ood of a supercomputer running for weeks on\nin is approximately zero and the reason for that  is because there's so many components working at\nthe same time the statistic the probability of  them working continuously is very low and so\nwe need to make sure that whenever there is a  well we checkpoint and restart as often as we\ncan but if we have the ability to detect a weak  chip or a weak note early we could retire it and\nmaybe swap in another processor that ability  to keep the utilization of the supercomputer\nHigh especially when you just spent $2 billion  building it is super important and so we put in a\nRas engine a reliability engine that does 100%  self test in system test of every single gate\nevery single bit of memory on the Blackwell  chip and all the memory that's connected to\nit it's almost as if we shipped with every  single chip its own Advanced tester that we\nCH test our chips with this is the first time  we're doing this super excited about it secure\nAI only this conference do they clap for Ras the  the uh secure AI uh obviously you've just spent\nhundreds of millions of dollars creating a very  important Ai and the the code the intelligence\nof that AI is encoded in the parameters you  want to make sure that on the one hand you   don't lose it on the other hand it doesn't get  contaminated and so we now have the ability to\nencrypt data of course at rest but also in transit  and while it's being computed it's all encrypted\nand so we now have the ability to encrypt and  transmission and when we're Computing it it is   in a trusted trusted environment trusted  uh engine environment and the last thing\nis decompression moving data in and out of these  nodes when the compute is so fast becomes really\nessential and so we've put in a high linee speed  compression engine and effectively moves data 20\ntimes times faster in and out of these computers  these computers are are so powerful and there's\nsuch a large investment the last thing we want  to do is have them be idle and so all of these\ncapabilities are intended to keep Blackwell  fed and as", "start_char_idx": 18425, "end_char_idx": 22958, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

don't lose it on the other hand it doesn't get  contaminated and so we now have the ability to\nencrypt data of course at rest but also in transit  and while it's being computed it's all encrypted\nand so we now have the ability to encrypt and  transmission and when we're Computing it it is   in a trusted trusted environment trusted  uh engine environment and the last thing\nis decompression moving data in and out of these  nodes when the compute is so fast becomes really\nessential and so we've put in a high linee speed  compression engine and effectively moves data 20\ntimes times faster in and out of these computers  these computers are are so powerful and there's\nsuch a large investment the last thing we want  to do is have them be idle and so all of these\ncapabilities are intended to keep Blackwell  fed and as busy as possible overall compared\nto Hopper it is two and a half times two and  a half times the fp8 performance for training\nper chip it is ALS it also has this new format  called fp6 so that even though the computation\nspeed is the same the bandwidth that's Amplified  because of the memory the amount of parameters\nyou can store in the memory is now Amplified  fp4 effectively doubles the throughput this\nis vitally important for inference one of the  things that that um is becoming very clear is\nthat whenever you use a computer with AI on the  other side when you're chatting with the chatbot\nwhen you're asking it to uh review or make an  image remember in the back is a GPU generating\ntokens some people call it inference but it's more  appropriately generation the way that Computing\nis done in the past was retrieval you would  grab your phone you would touch something um\nsome signals go off basically an email goes off  to some storage somewhere there's pre-recorded\ncontent somebody wrote a story or somebody made  an image or somebody recorded a video that record\npre-recorded content is then streamed back to  the phone and recomposed in a way based on a\nrecommender system to present the information to  you you know that in the future the vast majority\nof that content will not be retrieved and the  reason for that is because that was pre-recorded\nby somebody who doesn't understand the context  which is the reason why we have to retrieve so   much content if you can be working with an AI  that understands the context who you are for\nwhat reason you're fetching this information and  produces the information for you just the way you\nlike it the amount of energy we save the amount of  networking bandwidth we save the amount of waste\nof time we save will be tremendous the future  is generative which is the reason why we call\nit generative AI which is the reason why this  is a brand new industry the way we compute is\nfundamentally different we created a processor  for the generative AI era and one of the most\nimportant parts of it is content token generation  we call it this format is fp4 well that's a lot\nof computation 5x the Gen token generation 5x  the inference capability of Hopper seems like\nenough but why stop there the answer is it's  not enough and I'm going to show you why I'm\ngoing to show you why and so we would like to  have a bigger GPU even bigger than this one and\nso we decided to scale it and notice but first  let me just tell you how

but if you could  do that if you can find a way to do that and build\na system to do that that's cost effective that's  cost effective how incredible would it be that we\ncould have all these gpus

the seres of  this chip is is just a phenomenal invention so\nthat we could do direct drive to copper and as  a result you can build a system that looks like\nthis\nnow this system this system is kind of  insane this is one dgx this is what a dgx\nlooks like now remember just six years ago  it was pretty heavy but I was able to lift\nit I delivered the uh the uh first djx1 to  open Ai and and the researchers there it's\non you know the pictures are on the internet  and uh uh and we all autographed it uh and\num uh if you come to my office it's autographed  there is really beautiful and but but you could\nlift it uh this dgx this dgx that djx by  the way was 170 teraflops if you're not\nfamiliar with the numbering system that's  0.17 pedop flops so this is 720 the first\none I delivered to open AI was 0.17 you  could round it up to 0.2 won't make any\ndifference but and back then was like wow you  know 30 more teraflops and so this is now 720\npedop flops almost an exal flop for training and  the world's first one exal flops machine in one\nrack just so you know there are only a  couple two three exop flops machines on\nthe planet as we speak and so this  is an exop flops AI system in one\nsingle rack well let's take a look at the back of it so this is what makes it possible  that's the back that's the that's\nthe back the dgx MV link spine 130  terabytes per second goes through\nthe back of that chassis that is more  than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet so we we could basically send everything  to everybody within a second and so so we we have\n5,000 cables

know what's 3,000 lb okay  so 3,000 lb ton and a half so it's not quite an\nelephant so this is what a dgx looks like now  let's see what it looks like in operation okay\nlet's imagine what is what how do we put this  to work and what does that mean well if you   were to train a GPT model 1.8 trillion parameter  model it took it took about apparently about you\nknow 3 to 5 months or so uh with 25,000 amp  uh if we were to do it with hopper it would\nprobably take something like 8,000 gpus and  it would consume 15 megawatts 8,000 gpus on\n15 megawatts it would take 90 days about 3 months  and that would allows you to train something that\nis you know this groundbreaking AI model and  this is obviously not as expensive as as um\nas anybody would think but it's 8,000 8,000  gpus it's still a lot of money and so 8,000\ngpus 15 megawatts if you were to use Blackwell  to do this it would only take 2,000 gpus 2,000\ngpus same 90 days but this is the amazing part  only 4 me GS of power so from 15 yeah that's\nright and that's and that's our goal our goal  is to continuously drive down the cost and the\nenergy they're directly proportional to each other  cost and energy associated with the Computing so   that we can continue to expand and scale up the  computation that we have to do to train the Next\nGeneration models well this is training inference  or generation is vitally important going forward\nyou know probably some half of the time that  Nvidia gpus are in the cloud these days it's   being used for token generation you know they're  either doing co-pilot this or chat you know chat\nGPT that or um all these different models that  are being used when you're interacting with it   or generating IM generating images or generating  videos generating proteins generating chemicals\nthere's a bunch of gener generation going on  all of that is B in the category of computing\nwe call inference but inference is extremely  hard for large language models because these\nlarge language models have several properties  one they're very large and so it doesn't fit on   one GPU this is Imagine imagine Excel doesn't fit  on one GPU you know and imagine some application\nyou're running on a daily basis doesn't run  doesn't fit on one computer like a video game   doesn't fit on one computer and most in fact  do and many times in the past in

chatbot\nrequires a supercomputer in the back to run it  and that's the future the future is generative\nwith these chatbots and these chatbots are  trillions of tokens trillions of parameters\nand they have to generate tokens at interactive  rates now what does that mean well uh three to\ntokens is about a word I you know the the uh  you know space the final frontier these are the\nadventures

about  never seen Star Trek and so and so so here\nwe are we're trying to generate these tokens  when you're interacting with it you're hoping   that the tokens come back to you as quickly as  possible and as quickly as you can read it and\nso the ability for Generation tokens is really  important you have to paralyze the work of this\nmodel across many many gpus so that you could  achieve several things one on the one hand you\nwould like throughput because that throughput  reduces the cost the overall cost per token of\nuh generating so your throughput dictates the cost  of of uh delivering the service on the other hand\nyou have another interactive rate which is another  tokens per second where it's about per user and\nthat has everything to do with quality of service  and so these two things um uh compete against each\nother and we have to find a way to distribute  work across all of these different gpus and\nparalyze it in a way that allows us to achieve  both and it turns out the search search space\nis enormous you know I told you there's going to  be math involved and everybody's going oh dear I\nheard some gasp just now when I put up that slide  you know so so this this right here the the y axis\nis tokens per second data center throughput the  x- axis is tokens per second interactivity of the\nperson and notice the upper right is the best  you want interactivity to be very High number\nof tokens per second per user you want the tokens  per second of per data center to be very high the   upper upper right is is terrific however it's very  hard to do that and in order for us to search for\nthe best answer across every single one of those  intersections XY coordinates okay so you just look\nat every single XY coordinate all those blue dots  came from some repartitioning of the software some\noptimizing solution has to go and figure out what  whether to use use tensor parallel expert parallel\npipeline parallel or data parallel and distribute  this enormous model across all these G different\ngpus and sustain performance that you need this  exploration space would be impossible if not for\nthe programmability of nvidia's gpus and so we  could because of Cuda because we have such Rich\necosystem we could explore this universe and find  that green roof line it turns out that green roof\nline notice you got tp2 EPA dp4 it means two  parall two uh tensor parallel tensor parallel\nacross two gpus expert parallels across eight data  parallel across four notice on the other end you\ngot tensor parallel cross 4 and expert parallel  across 16 the configuration the distribution of\nthat software it's a different different um  runtime that would produce these different\nresults and you have to go discover that roof  line well

just\none configuration of a computer imagine all of the  models being created around the world and all the\ndifferent different um uh configurations  of of uh systems that are going to be available so now that you understand the  basics let's take a look at inference of\nBlackwell compared to Hopper and this is this  is the extraordinary thing in one generation\nbecause we created a system that's designed  for trillion parameter gener generative AI the\ninference capability of Blackwell is off the  charts and in fact it is some 30 times Hopper\ny for large language models for large language  models like Chad GPT and others like it the blue\nline is Hopper I gave you imagine we didn't  change the architecture of Hopper we just\nmade it a bigger chip we just used the latest you  know greatest uh 10 terab you know terabytes per\nsecond we connected the two chips together we got  this giant 208 billion parameter chip how would we\nhave performed if nothing else changed and it  turns out quite wonderfully quite wonderfully\nand that's the purple line but not as great as it  could be and and that's where the fp4 tensor core\nthe new Transformer engine and very importantly  the MV link switch and the reason for that is\nbecause all these gpus have to share the results  partial products whenever they do all to all all\nall gather whenever they communicate with each  other that mvlink switch is communicating almost\n10 times faster than what we could do in the  past using the fastest networks Okay so Blackwell\nis going to be just an amazing system for a  generative Ai and in the future in the future\ndata centers are going to be thought of as I  mentioned earlier as an AI Factory an AI Factory's\ngoal in life is to generate revenues generate  in this case intelligence in this facility not\ngenerating electricity as in AC generator but of  the last Industrial Revolution and this Industrial\nRevolution the generation of intelligence and  so this ability is super super important the\nexcitement of Blackwell is really off the charts  you know when we first when we first um uh you\nknow this this is a year and a half ago two years  ago I guess two years ago when we first started to   to go to market with hopper you know we had the  benefit of of uh two two uh two csps uh joined\nus in a lunch and and we were you know delighted  um and so we had two customers uh we have more\nnow unbelievable excitement for Blackwell  unbelievable excitement and there's a whole\nbunch of different configurations of course I  showed you the configurations that slide into   the hopper form factor so that's easy to upgrade  I showed you examples that are liquid cooled that\nare the extreme versions of it one entire rack  that's that's uh connected by mvlink 72 uh we're\ngoing to Blackwell is going to be ramping to the  world's AI companies of which there are so many\nnow doing amazing work in different modalities the  csps every CSP is geared up all the OEM and odms\nRegional clouds Sovereign AIS and Telos all over  the world are signing up to launch with Blackwell\nthis Blackwell Blackwell would be the the the  most successful product launch in our history\nand so I can't wait wait to see that um I want  to thank I want to thank some partners that that   are joining us in this uh AWS is gearing up for  Blackwell they're uh they're going to build

widraw one of our leading manufacturing\nPartners is building digital twins of Nvidia  dgx and hgx factories using custom software\ndeveloped with Omniverse sdks and apis for  their newest Factory wraw started with a\ndigital twin to virtually integrate their  multi-ad and process simulation data into   a unified view testing and optimizing layouts  in this physically accurate digital environment\nincreased worker efficency icy by 51% during  construction the Omniverse digital twin was\nused to verify that the physical build matched  the digital plans identifying any discrepancies\nearly has helped avoid costly change orders and  the results have been impressive using a digital\ntwin helped bring wion's Factory online in half  the time just 2 and 1/2 months instead of five\nin operation the Omniverse digital twin helps  widraw rapidly Test new layouts to accommodate\nnew processes or improve operations in  the existing space and monitor real-time\noperations using live iot data from every machine  on the production line which ultimately enabled\nwion to reduce End to-end Cycle Times by 50%  and defect rates by 40% with Nvidia Ai

ever been sequenced this is\ncompletely revolutionary well those models are  incredibly hard to use um for incredibly hard\nfor people to build and so what we're going to  do is we're going to build them we're going to   build them for uh the the researchers around  the world and it won't be the only one there'll\nbe many other models that we create and so  let me show you what we're going to do with it virtual screening for new medicines  is a computationally intractable problem\nexisting techniques can only scan billions  of compounds and require days on thousands of\nstandard compute nodes to identify new drug  candidates Nvidia biion Nemo Nims enable a\nnew generative screening Paradigm using Nims  for protein structure prediction with Alpha   fold molecule generation with MIM and docking  with diff dock we can now generate and Screen\ncandidate molecules in a matter of minutes MIM  can connect to custom applications to steer the\ngenerative process iteratively optimizing for  desired properties these applications can be\ndefined with biion Nemo microservices or built  from scratch here a physics based simulation\noptimizes for a molecule's ability to bind to  a Target protein while optimizing for other\nfavorable molecular properties in parallel MIM  generates high quality drug-like molecules that\nbind to the Target and are synthesizable  translating to a higher probability of   developing successful medicines faster biion Nemo  is enabling a new paradigm in drug Discovery with\nNims providing OnDemand microservices  that can be combined to build powerful\ndrug Discovery workflows like denovo protein  design or ided molecule generation for virtual\nscreening bio Nims are helping researchers  and developers reinvent computational drug\ndesign Nvidia M MIM MIM cord diff there's a whole  bunch of other models whole bunch of other models\ncomputer vision models robotics models and  even of course some really really terrific\nopen source language models these models are  groundbreaking however it's hard for companies\nto use how would you use it how would you bring  it into your company and integrate it into your   workflow how would you package it up and run it  remember earlier I just said that inference is\nan extraordinary computation problem how would  you do the optimization for each and every one\nof these models and put together the Computing  stack necessary to run that supercomputer so that\nyou can run the models in your company and so we  have a great idea we're going to invent a new way\ninvent a new way for you to receive and operate  software this software comes basically in a\ndigital box we call it a container and we call it  the Nvidia inference micr service a Nim and let me\nexplain to you what it is a Nim it's a pre-trained  model so it's pretty clever and it is packaged\nand optimized to run across nvidia's install  base which is very very large what's inside\nit is incredible you have all these pre-trained  state-ofthe-art open source models they could be\nopen source they could be from one of our partners  it could be created by us like Nvidia mull it is\npackaged up with all of its dependencies so Cuda  the right version CNN the right version tensor RT\nllm Distributing across the multiple gpus Tred and  inference server all completely packaged together\nit's optimized depending on whether you have a  single GPU multi- GPU or multi node of gpus it's\noptimized for that and it's connected up with apis  that are simple to use now this think about what\nan AI API is an AI API is an interface that you  just talk to and so this is a piece of software in\nthe future that has a really simple API and that  API called human and these packages incredible\nbodies of software will be optimized and packaged  and we'll put it on a website and you can download\nit you could take it with you you could run  it in any Cloud you can run it in your own   data center you can run in workstations if it fit  and all you have to do is come to ai. nvidia.com\nwe call it Nvidia inference microservice but  inside the company we all call it Nims okay\njust imagine you know one of some someday there  there's going to be one of these chat Bots and\nthese chat Bots is going to just be in a Nim and  you you'll uh you'll assemble a whole bunch of\nchat Bots and that's the way software

another Nim that Nim would\nmaybe uh understand sap the language of sap is  abap it might understand service now and it go\nretrieve some information from their platforms  it might then hand that

Nims have been\npackaged up and ready to work on your systems so  long as you have video gpus in your data center in\nthe cloud this this Nims will work together as a  team and do amazing things and so we decided this\nis such a great idea we're going to go do that and  so Nvidia has Nims running all over the company we\nhave chatbots being created all over the place  and one of the mo most important chatbots of\ncourse is a chip designer chatbot you might not  be surprised we care a lot about building chips\nand so we want to build chatbots AI co-pilots that  are co-designers with our engineers and so this\nis the way we did it so we got ourselves a llama  llama 2 this is a 70b and it's you know packaged\nup in a NM and we asked it you know uh what is a  CTL Well turns out CTL is an internal uh program\nand it has a internal proprietary language but  it thought the CTL was a combinatorial timing\nlogic and so it describes you know conventional  knowledge of CTL but that's not very useful to us\nand so we gave it a whole bunch of new examples  you know this is no different than employee\nonboarding an employee uh we say you know thanks  for that answer it's completely wrong um and and\nuh and then we present to them uh this is what  a CTL is okay and so this is what a CTL is at\nNvidia and the CTL as you can see you know CTL  stands for compute Trace Library which makes\nsense you know we were tracing compute Cycles  all the time and it wrote the program isn't that\namazing and so the productivity of our chip  designers can go up this is what you can do with\na Nim first thing you can do with is customize  it we have a service called Nemo microservice\nthat helps you curate the data preparing the  data so that you could teach this on board   this AI you fine-tune them and then you guardrail  it you can even evaluate the answer evaluate its\nperformance against um other other examples and  so that's called the Nemo micr service now the\nthing that's that's emerging here is this there  are three elements three pillars of what we're   doing the first pillar is of course inventing  the technology for um uh AI models and running\nAI models and packaging it up for you the second  is to create tools to help you modify it first\nis having the AI technology second is to help you  modify it and third is infrastructure for you to\nfine-tune it and if you like deploy it you could  deploy it on our infrastructure called dgx cloud\nor you can employ deploy it on Prem you can deploy  it anywhere you like once you develop it it's\nyours to take

industry\non AI what tsmc does for us building chips and  so we go to it with our go to tsmc with our big\nIdeas they manufacture and we take it with us and  so exactly the same thing here AI Foundry and the\nthree pillar ERS are the NIMS Nemo microservice  and dgx Cloud the other thing that you could teach\nthe Nim to do is to understand your proprietary  information remember inside our company the vast\nmajority of our data is not in the cloud it's  inside our company it's been sitting there you   know being used all the time and and gosh it's  it's basically invidious intelligence we would\nlike to take that data learn its meaning like we  learned the meaning of almost anything else that\nwe just talked about learn its meaning and then  reindex that knowledge into a new type of database\ncalled a vector database and so you essentially  take structured data or unstructured data you\nlearn its meaning you encode its meaning so now  this becomes an AI database and that AI database\nin the future once you create it you can talk to  it and so let me give you an example of what you   could do so suppose you create you get you got a  whole bunch of multi modality data and one good\nexample of that is PDF so you take the PDF you  take all of your PDFs all the all your favorite\nyou know the stuff that that is proprietary to  you critical to your company you can encode it\njust as we encoded pixels of a cat and it becomes  the word cat we can encode all of your PDF and it\nturns into vectors that are now stored inside  your vector database it becomes the proprietary\ninformation of your company and once you have  that proprietary information you can chat to   it it's an it's a smart database and so you just  ch chat with data and how how much more enjoyable\nis that you know we for for our software team  you know they just chat with the bugs database\nyou know how many bugs was there last night um  are we making any progress and then after you're\ndone talking to this uh bugs database you need  therapy and so so we have another chatbot for\nyou you can do\nit okay so we call this Nemo Retriever and the  reason for that is because ultimately it's job\nis to go retrieve information as quickly as  possible and you just talk to it hey retrieve   me this information it goes if brings it back to  you and do you mean this you go yeah perfect okay\nand so we call it the Nemo retriever well the  Nemo service helps you create all these things   and we have all all these different Nims we  even have Nims of digital humans I'm Rachel\nyour AI care manager okay so so it's a really  short clip but there were so many videos to\nshow you I guess so many other demos to show  you and so I I had to cut this one short but   this is Diana she is a digital human Nim  and and uh you just talked to her and she's\nconnected in this case to Hippocratic ai's large  language model for healthcare and it's truly amazing she is just super smart about Healthcare  things you know and so after you're done after my\nmy Dwight my VP of software engineering talks to  the chatbot for bugs database then you come over\nhere and talk to Diane and and so so uh Diane  is is um completely animated with AI and she's\na digital human uh there's so many companies that  would like to build they're sitting on gold mines\nthe the Enterprise IT

text form the AI imitates Us by reading a lot\nof the language to predict the next words it's  imitating You by studying all of the patterns\nand all the other previous examples of course it  has to understand context and so on so forth but   once it understands the context it's essentially  imitating you we take all of the data we put it\ninto a system like dgx we compress it into a  large language model trillions and trillions of\nparameters become billions and billion trillions  of tokens becomes billions of parameters these   billions of parameters becomes your AI well  in order for us to go to the next wave of AI\nwhere the AI understands the physical world we're  going to need three computers the first computer\nis still the same computer it's that AI computer  that now is going to be watching video and maybe\nit's doing synthetic data generation and maybe  there's a lot of human examples just as we have\nhuman examples in text form we're going to have  human examples in articulation form and the AIS\nwill watch us understand what is happening and try  to adapt it for themselves into the context and\nbecause it can generalize with these Foundation  models maybe

"it\ninto a system like dgx we compress it into a  large language model trillions and trillions of\nparameters become billions and billion trillions  of tokens becomes billions of parameters these   billions of parameters becomes your AI well  in order for us to go to the next wave of AI\nwhere the AI understands the physical world we're  going to need three computers the first computer\nis still the same computer it's that AI computer  that now is going to be watching video and maybe\nit's doing synthetic data generation and maybe  there's a lot of human examples just as we have\nhuman examples in text form we're going to have  human examples in articulation form and the AIS\nwill watch us understand what is happening and try  to adapt it for themselves into the context and\nbecause it can generalize with these Foundation  models maybe these robots can also perform in\nthe physical world fairly generally so I just  described in very simple terms essentially what\njust happened in large language models except  the chat GPT moment for robotics may be right   around the corner and so we've been building  the end to-end systems for robotics for some\ntime I'm super super proud of the work we have  the AI system dgx we have the lower system which\nis called agx for autonomous systems the world's  first robotics processor when we first built this\nthing people are what are you guys building  it's a s so it's one chip it's designed to be   very low power but it's designed for high-speed  sensor processing and Ai and so if you want to\nrun Transformers in a car or you want to run  Transformers in a in a you know anything um\nthat moves uh we have the perfect computer for you  it's called the Jetson and so the dgx on top for\ntraining the AI the Jetson is the autonomous  processor and in the middle we need another\ncomputer whereas large language models have the  benefit of you providing your examples and then\ndoing reinforcement learning human feedback what  is the reinforcement learning human feedback of a\nrobot well it's reinforcement learning physical  feedback that's how you align the robot that's\nhow you that's how the robot knows that as  it's learning these articulation capabilities   and manipulation capabilities it's going to adapt  properly into the laws of physics and so we need\na simulation engine that represents the world  digitally for the robot so that the robot has\na gym to go learn how to be a robot we call that  virtual world Omniverse and the computer that runs\nOmniverse is called ovx and ovx the computer  itself is hosted in the Azure Cloud okay and\nso basically we built these three things these  three systems on top of it we have algorithms   for every single one now I'm going to show you one  super example of how Ai and Omniverse are going to\nwork together the example I'm going to show you  is kind of insane but it's going to be very very   close to tomorrow it's a robotics building this  robotics building is called a warehouse inside the\nrobotics building are going to be some autonomous  systems some of the autonomous systems are going   to be called humans and some of the autonomous  systems are going to be called forklifts and\nthese autonomous systems are going to interact  with each other of course autonomously and it's\ngoing to be overlooked upon by this Warehouse to  keep everybody out of Harm's

amount of software that goes on top of it   is insane but the reason why we can do it at all  is because it's 100% Cuda compatible everything\nthat we do everything that we do in our company  is in service of our developers and by us being\nable to maintain this Rich ecosystem and make  it compatible with everything that you access\nfrom us we can bring all of that incredible  capability to this little tiny computer we\ncall Jetson a robotics computer we also today  are announcing this incredibly Advanced new SDK\nwe call it Isaac perceptor Isaac perceptor most  most of the Bots today are pre-programmed they're\neither following rails on the ground digital rails  or theyd be following April tags but in the future\nthey're going to have perception and the reason  why you want that is so that you could easily   program it you say would you like to go from  point A to point B and it will figure out a way\nto navigate its way there so by only programming  waypoints the entire route could be adaptive the\nentire environment could be reprogrammed just  as I showed you at the very beginning with the   warehouse you can't do that with pre-programmed  agvs if those boxes fall down they just all gum\nup and they just wait there for somebody to come  clear it and so now with the Isaac perceptor\nwe have incredible state-of-the-art Vision  odometry 3D reconstruction and in addition\nto 3D reconstruction depth perception the reason  for that is so that you can have two modalities   to keep an eye on what's happening in the world  Isaac perceptor the most used robot today is the\nmanipulator manufacturing arms and they are also  pre-programmed the computer vision algorithms the\nAI algorithms the control and path planning  algorithms that are geometry aware incredibly\ncomputational intensive we have made these Cuda  accelerated so we have the world's first Cuda\naccelerated motion planner that is geometry aware  you put something in front of it it comes up with\na new plan and our articulates around it it has  excellent perception for pose estimation of a 3D\nobject not just not it's pose in 2D but it's pose  in 3D so it has to imagine what's around and how\nbest to grab it so the foundation pose the grip  foundation and the um articulation algorithms\nare now available we call it Isaac manipulator and  they also uh just run on nvidia's computers we are\nare starting to do some really great work in the  next generation of Robotics the next generation\nof Robotics will likely be a humanoid robotics  we now have the Necessary Technology and as I\nwas describing earlier the Necessary Technology  to imagine generalized human robotics in a way\nhuman robotics is likely easier and the reason  for that is because we have a lot more imitation\ntraining data that we can provide there robots  because we are constructed in a very similar   way it is very likely that the human robotics  will be much more useful in our world because\nwe created the world to be something that we can  interoperate in and work well in and the way that\nwe set up our workstations and Manufacturing  and Logistics they were designed for for humans   they were designed for people and so these human  robotics will likely be much more productive to\ndeploy while we're creating just like we're doing  with the others the entire stack starting from the\ntop a foundation model that learns from watching  video human IM human examples it could be in video\nform it could be in virtual reality form we then  created a gym for it called Isaac

will be much more useful in our world because\nwe created the world to be something that we can  interoperate in and work well in and the way that\nwe set up our workstations and Manufacturing  and Logistics they were designed for for humans   they were designed for people and so these human  robotics will likely be much more productive to\ndeploy while we're creating just like we're doing  with the others the entire stack starting from the\ntop a foundation model that learns from watching  video human IM human examples it could be in video\nform it could be in virtual reality form we then  created a gym for it called Isaac reinforcement\nlearning gym which allows the humanoid robot to  learn how to adapt to the physical world and then\nan incredible computer the same computer that's  going to go into a robotic car this computer\nwill run inside a human or robot called Thor  it's designed for Transformer engines we've\ncombined several of these into one video this is  something that you're going to really love take a\nlook it's not enough for humans  to  imagine we have to\ninvent and explore real and push  Beyond what's been done fair amount of\ndetail we create smarter and\nfaster we push it to fail so it can\nlearn we teach it then help it teach  itself we broaden its understanding\nto take on new challenges with absolute\nprecision and succeed we make it perceive and\nmove and even reason so it can share our world with us\nthis is where inspiration leads us the  next Frontier this is Nvidia Project\nGroot a general purpose Foundation model for  humanoid robot learning the group model takes\nmultimodal instructions and past interactions  as input and produces the next action for the\nrobot to execute we developed Isaac lab a  robot learning application to train gr on\nOmniverse Isaac Sim and we scale out with osmo a  new compute orchestration service that coordinates\nwork flows across dgx systems for training and  ovx systems for simulation with these tools we\ncan train Groot in physically based simulation  and transfer zero shot to the real world the\nGroot model will enable a robot to learn from a  handful of human demonstrations so it can help\nwith everyday tasks and emulate human movement  just by observing us this is made possible\nwith nvidia's technologies that can understand  humans from videos train models and simulation\nand ultimately deploy them directly to physical  robots connecting group to a large language model\neven allows it to generate motions by following  natural language instructions hi go1 can you give\nme a
