# The Economics of AI

I was chatting with bria.ai, which is a visual generative AI platform for creators, and we got into this discussion about how much to train a model. They have a multimodal model that is claimed to be trained from the ground up. For that, it took 280 A100 for 2 weeks to train the model. And if you go to lambdalabs.com to rent an A100, it will cost you \$2.5 per hr. So, the total cost to train the model once is \$2.5 per hr x 280 x 24 x 14 = \$235k
            
So, let's do some math. If you've got 10k users forking over $10 each month, you'd break even on just the training cost in a smidge over two months. That's not even touching the iceberg of data costs, salaries, marketing... you get the point.
        
So what'd a start-up do?:
1. Hack up the price? Sure, if you want to put the breaks on growth and enjoy the melodious screams of your VCs.
2. Figure out more growth as MidJourney riding the AI hype with their 1.5M-2.6M active users. Tempting, with all that AI mania money floating around.
3. Or maybe, just maybe, use some of that sweet investor cash to bring in the brainiacs who can fine-tune the model, cutting costs without skimping on quality. Sounds smart, right?

I could be naive but I'd bet option 2 is the easiest way to go now with the all AI hype that floods \$\$\$ into the AI startups. But eventually, option 3 is the option that leads you into the final round of the sustainable business game.
        
And let's not forget the AI value debate. Sure, for complex, creative tasks, AI's a no-brainer, outperforming traditional code by achieving something that regular logic just couldn't handle at scale. But for the simple stuff? It's a harder sell. Why go AI for a task as simple as 1+1 (using \$\$ inference) when a basic function would do the trick unless you're keen on splurging on software engineering talent?
        
Yet, there's a twist. Even for these 'simple' tasks, when you bundle them up and look at the big picture, AI starts making a whole lot of sense. What matters is the value of integrated automation. Your SWEs built a good abstraction and architecture for a platform to be scalable. AI can help augment/maintain the system with less cost and less time from people. And this is where the value of AI comes in for even simpler tasks. Independently, simpler tasks are not worth the cost of AI, but when you integrate them, the table can be turned. 

So, it's not just about the hefty upfront cost of training an AI model. It's about weighing the ongoing costs (infrastructure, maintenance, talent, etc.) against the value AI brings in terms of customizable, integrated automation. Don't fire all your SWEs. Have AI augment their lives and support them in maintaining the system to free up their tedious on-call live at least.
