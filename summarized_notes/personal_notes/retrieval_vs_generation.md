# Retrieval vs. Generation

This was mentioned in the keynote by Jensen Huang. He said
                    
> The way that computing was done is Retrieval, you would grab your phone and touch something. And some signals go off basically
to some source somewhere that is PRE-RECORDED content somebody wrote, like a story, image, or video. Then Pre-recorded content is streamed back to the phone and recomposed in a way based on a recommender system to present the information to you. The future of the vast majority of the content will not be retrieved and the reason is those pre-recorded content was made by somebody 
who doesn't understand the context which is the reason why we retrieve so much content. If you can work with an AI that understands the context, like who you are, for what reason you're fetching this information, and produce the information for you just the way you like it. The amount of energy we save, the amount of resource we save, the amount of wasted time we save will be tremendous."
        
Take the following example when I want to know which fasteners (diameter and length) to use for an outdoor deck with 2x6 redwood:

1. My first try was to look it up on Google, but I ended up on several DIY websites. The overwhelming number of ads made it tough to find the information I needed.
2. I tried watching a tutorial on YouTube. It was a 10-minute video. Nah, who knows if it has my answer or not? I am too impatient.
3. Then I hopped on perplexity.ai and asked the same questions, and I got the AI-generated answer in less than 5 seconds (with references).

What struck me was how the AI seemed to intuitively understand what I was looking for amidst a sea of diverse information. While I still value the depth and quality of pre-recorded tutorials and guides, I'm increasingly convinced of the potential of generative AI. It's about connecting people with the right information in the right context - and that's where I put my money at.
