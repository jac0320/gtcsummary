            üëã Hi there! I am Site Wang. This is a summary of my GTC-2024 conference experience. 
            
            NVIDIA GTC 2024 was NVIDIA's flagship annual conference focused on the latest advancements 
            in AI and other cutting-edge technologies.

            I figured the best to summarize the AI conference is to use AI. Hence, leveraging some rudimentary
            learning of the AI technologies, I built this experience to let people interact with my experience using generative AI. **You can directly ask quesitons through the chat interface below. Or visit each tab to explore more information in details.**
