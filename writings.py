- **Nvidia Dynamo**: ‚ÄúOperating system‚Äù for AI factories, orchestrating model parallelism (pipeline, tensor, expert) and dynamic resource allocation.  
- **Nvidia NIMS**: Open-source AI model framework for advanced reasoning.  
- **Semantic Storage**: Future enterprise storage will continuously embed data (not just store/retrieve) for more intelligent querying.

---

## 7. Robotics & Physical AI

- **Omniverse + Cosmos**: Large-scale synthetic data generation and simulation for robotics training.  
- **Newton Physics Engine**: Partnership among Nvidia, DeepMind, and Disney Research, providing real-time, GPU-accelerated rigid/soft body simulation.  
- **Groot N1**: A dual-system (‚Äúfast‚Äù vs. ‚Äúslow‚Äù thinking) generalist humanoid-robot model. Announced as open-sourced for developers.

---

## 8. Notable Partnerships & Industry Adoption

- **GM**: Uses Nvidia platforms for next-gen autonomous driving (training, simulation, in-car computation).  
- **Cisco & T-Mobile**: Collaborations on edge AI and 5G radio networks.
