            üëã Hi there! I am Site Wang. This is a summary of my GTC-2024 conference experience. 
            
            NVIDIA GTC 2024 was NVIDIA's flagship annual conference focused on the latest advancements 
            in AI and other cutting-edge technologies.

            I figured the best to summarize the AI conference is to use AI. Hence, leveraging some rudimentary
            learning of the AI technologies, I built this experience to let people interact with my experience using generative AI. **You can directly ask quesitons through the chat interface below. Or visit each tab to explore more information in details.**

            Jensen Huang's GTC 2024 keynote highlighted several major announcements and developments from NVIDIA:

            NVIDIA's Blackwell Architecture: Huang announced the Blackwell architecture, which he said will accelerate AI products in late 2024. Blackwell is designed to run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs) at 25x less cost and energy compared to current solutions[4].

            NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip: Alongside the Blackwell GPUs, NVIDIA unveiled the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which connects multiple Blackwell GPUs[4].

            Partnerships and Integrations: Huang detailed major partnerships and integrations with cloud providers and enterprise companies:

            - NVIDIA's full-stack AI platform will be integrated into Oracle's Enterprise AI[4].
            - AWS will provide access to NVIDIA Grace Blackwell GPU-based Amazon EC2 instances and NVIDIA DGX Cloud with Blackwell[4].
            - NVIDIA will accelerate Google Cloud with the Grace Blackwell AI computing platform and NVIDIA DGX Cloud service[4].
            - Microsoft will adopt the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell Superchip to accelerate Azure[4].
            - Dell will use NVIDIA's AI infrastructure and software, and will eventually incorporate the Grace Blackwell Superchip into its PowerEdge servers[4].
            - SAP will add NVIDIA's retrieval-augmented generation capabilities into its Joule copilot and use NVIDIA NIMs and other joint services[4].

            Other Announcements:
            - NVIDIA announced cuPQC, a library to accelerate post-quantum cryptography[4].
            - NVIDIA unveiled its X800 series of network switches to accelerate AI infrastructure[4].

            The keynote was widely praised, with Bloomberg calling NVIDIA the center stage of the "AI Era"[2] and Forbes describing it as the "Woodstock of AI"[2]. Overall, Huang's keynote showcased NVIDIA's leadership in AI and its deep partnerships across the technology industry[1][2][3][4][5].
